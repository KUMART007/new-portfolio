                adminstration and staff they are just so awesome hard working people who belives there is a
                reward for hard work and beleives that there is life outside work. <br>I have been trying to put up with
                the
                current thread of work balance so that I should be able to follow new ideas and <br>learn new
                skills
                I decided to do the web developing programe. To be come a Web Developer" <br> Upon doing this I
                came
                to understand how challenging it is but as I work through it, i strongly believe in myself and my
                common slogan "never never give up" yeah, pretty basic I know right but that is who i am simple guy.<span class="italic"> </span>
